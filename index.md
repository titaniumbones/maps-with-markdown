# Amazonian Seattle: Gentrification and Urban Renewal in Seattle, Washington

Gentrification is a term used to describe the transformation of an area that is brought upon by an influx of more affluent residents. More specifically it is used to describe the rapid urban renewal of areas that were once occupied by lower-income residents. These lower-income areas are frequently dilapidated and poverty-stricken, but due to a sudden influx of wealth and urban development, they are transformed into regions with increased economic activity, decreased crime rates, and increased property values.

However, these changes do not come without a cost, as they often force the relocation of existing residents and businesses who cannot keep up with the shift in the cost of living brought upon by rising average household incomes and real estate values. Gentrification is often associated with income disparity, wealth inequality, and polarization, and critics argue that while gentrification can reshape a city, it does so at the cost of pushing low-income individuals out of their homes.

One of the most recent and well-documented cases of gentrification in the United States can be found in Seattle, Washington, where one company has managed to singlehandedly transform and reshape the heart and face of the South Lake Union.

In this report, I will discuss the impact of urban renewal and uncontrolled expansion on the cost of living in urban city centers. More specifically, I will argue that the geographical location and proximity of Amazon's massive Seattle campus is directly responsible for the transformation of the once decaying South Lake Union neighborhood and the increased cost of living in SLU and adjacent city regions. This assertion can be made given the rapid increase in housing costs, and drastic, unmatched increases to the cost of living in the South Lake Union region.

For this formerly quiet and derelict no-man's land of warehouses, it is without a doubt that the geographic location of the Amazon headquarters has changed the future of South Lake Union. Historically, this area was home to low-rise industrial buildings, warehouses and parking lots. Today, it is home to one of the fastest-growing urban neighborhoods in North America.

Headquartered in the South Lake Union district of Seattle, Washington, Amazon is the single largest private employer in the city of Seattle with more than 40,000 employees [1] working for a city that has a population of 713,700 people [2]. Amazon in effect employs 5.6% of a bustling city that it has helped to build. In fact, in the decade since Amazon announced Seattle as the new home of its headquarters, the company's office building growth has grown exponentially each year. Amazon now currently occupies 37 offices, and over 8.1 million square feet of office space in Seattle alone [3].

However, these changes come at a cost. Seattle real estate database, Zillow, has released studies to corroborate that the online shopping giant's campus is directly responsible for increasing rental rates across the city. Neighborhoods where South Lake Union Tech Corridor workers reside in are associated with high occupancy and grossly increasing rental rates. These areas demonstrate statistically significant increases in rental costs, with median rents rising $0.60 per square foot from 2011 to 2015 alone [7]. For a 1000 sq ft property, this represents a $600.00/month increase in rent within a span of four years.

Amazon's staggering expansion into the SLU corridor has also resulted in disparate increases in the cost of living, and while it is true that Seattle has become an expensive city in recent years (largely in part due to high-profile companies like Amazon and Microsoft), studies have shown that the South Lake Union region has a disproportionately higher cost of living. A study by the Council on Economic and Community Relations found that Seattle is about 24% more expensive than the average U.S. city and an individual earning an annual income of $50,000 elsewhere in the U.S. would have to earn $62,000 per year to maintain a similar standard of living in Seattle [8].

However, the cost of living in South Lake Union is even higher than the Seattle average. SLU's cost of living is reportedly 25% higher than the Seattle average and 45% higher than the national average [9]. Additionally, the cost of housing is 75% higher than the national average [9]. That is to say, the South Lake Union region is disproportionately more expensive than the city of Seattle as a whole. From a quiet industrial district to a sprawling technological hub, SLU has transformed into one of the most expensive areas to live in within Seattle proper. Rising rental rates has led to forced relocation, with many long-term residents fleeing to more affordable areas. Along with the relocation of residents, the shuttering of long-standing local businesses has become a common sight in this real-estate hot spot. Understandably so, when a low-income, low-cost area transforms virtually overnight into one of the most expensive areas in the city.

The rapid development of office spaces in the area has lead to significant socio-economic changes as well. In particular, there has been a marked shift in the demographics of the region. According to the 2010 Census, Seattle had a population of 563,374 people prior to Amazon's expansion into the city [10]. At the time, 67.1% of Seattle residents were Caucasian, 16.6% Asian, 8.4% of African origin, and 1.0% Native American [10]. However, the year 2010 marked the beginning of a new era. As Amazon began to move into the new Seattle headquarters, Amazon's rapid development into the city caused an influx of educated young, male, white-collar workers to move in to the city from all across America.

While Amazon has not yet revealed the gender or race demographics of it's US technical workforce, it is largely believed to be as a result of attempting to hide a lack of workplace diversity under the numbers of low-paid warehouse workers. Even then, Amazon's global workforce of 150,000 workers is only 37% female [15]. In the US, Amazon's workforce is 60% White, 15% Black, 13% Asian, and 9% Latino [15]. Again, these numbers represent the total workforce, including a large score of warehouse workers, which is not representative of Amazon's technical sector. This gender void in the technological sector is well documented, and a study by career website Paysa.com found that for every five employees who have moved to Seattle in the last decade for a job in the technical sector, four are male and one is female [11]. Statistical Atlas also reveals that these numbers are reflected in SLU's demographics, which are drastically out of line with the rest of Seattle. Most obviously, South Lake Union is younger, with recent tech sector graduates making up much of SLU's 25-29 cohort represents 24.6% of the population of the SLU corridor [12].

So what does this mean for South Lake Union? It simply shows that the neighborhood demographics reflects that of the demographics of the key employer for this city. It also shows that one business was able to singlehandedly transform and reshape the heart and face of the South Lake Union. More specifically, it demonstrates that the geographical location and proximity of Amazon's massive Seattle campus is directly responsible for transforming this once decaying neighborhood; directly impacting it's demographic makeup, changing the course of it's history, and increasing the cost of living in SLU and adjacent city regions. And finally, it demonstrates the power of gentrification: that one technological giant was able to overwrite the future of this formerly quaint and quiet industrial area.
