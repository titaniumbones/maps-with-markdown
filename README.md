Essay

You should write a short essay, approximately 500 words (~ 2 pages double-spaced, if we were using word processors) addressing a small, specific historical topic with a spatial history component. That is, the “spatial” element shouldn’t just be an afterthought, but should be at the centre of your analysis. Moreover, your topic should be Toronto-centric – you should choose a neighbourhood or theme that is relevant to the course and especially to the Toronto Region. You should pick something that you (a) know something about already, and (b) are interested in. . The essay should introduce the reader to the topic, and make a not-too-complex argument which, again, highlights the spatial component.
