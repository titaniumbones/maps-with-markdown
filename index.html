### Strategic Commerce, Diplomacy, and Warfare in the Lake Ontario Region

The Great Lakes region has always been a contested territory, control over which meant access to transportation, sustenance, and trade. Before the arrival of the French, British, and eventually, the Americans, the Iroquois, Huron, and Algonquin tribes competed for the rich resources which the Lake and its surrounding regions offered. Once the Europeans arrived it became evident that mutual accommodation over the Great Lakes became necessary, as the space became what Richard White calls the “Middle Ground” for both formal and informal interactions between the Native Americans and the settlers [(Beatty-Medina and Rinehart, 2012: xiv)]( https://www.amazon.ca/Contested-Territories-Americans-Non-Natives-1700-1850/dp/1611860458). The opinion of “to whom” the Lakes belonged seemed to irrevocably diverge between the two groups. Despite their differences, the agreed mutual use of the regions of Lake Ontario demonstrated, as trader and interpreter John Long wrote, the “necessity, of a strict alliance with them [Native Americans]”, for as long as the British were to, “retain any possessions in Canada" [(Long,1791:Preface)](https://archive.org/details/voyagestravelsof00long).

Several key forts in the Lake Ontario region played to the strategical advantage of different actors. It is crucial to recognize that throughout the 18th century, negotiations with Native American groups was key for any consolidated settlements. For example, the British Fort Niagara, which acted as a gateway for supplies going to all western posts was in part possible due to the 1763-1764 peace conference wherein the Senecas, who controlled the Niagara corridor at the time, ceded it to the British. Acknowledging the fact that the British could neither be defeated or driven away, the Senecas, like most other indigenous groups, agreed to mutually beneficial conditions through which the control over the Lake and its waterways could be shared.

In another incident, pitting the Iroquois against the French, the British would frequently warn that the construction of Fort Detroit (and previously Fort Frontenac) would lead to the annihilation of the Iroquois hunting grounds and even the eventual enslavement of the Iroquois people. Iroquois met with their rivals during 1700 and 1701 in order to discuss a settlement of peace. It was here that the Iroquois expressed their cultural and historical affinity to the northern part of the Great Lakes,  and especially the hunting grounds surrounding Fort Frontenac which they claimed to have hunted and fished freely, “since the beginning of the world"[(Brandao and Starna, 1996:212)]( http://www.jstor.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/483396).

In this turn-of-the-century agreement, after decades of bloodshed which led to the annihilation of 50% of the Iroquois warrior population, the French assured the Iroquois that Fort Detroit would serve as a deterrent for future hunting conflicts north of Lake Ontario and Erie [(Brandao and Starna, 1996:231)](http://www.jstor.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/stable/483396). Such a peace would be beneficial for French trade and for the Native Americans it would allow fur trade with Albany, a major trading post east of the Great Lakes. The forts demonstrated the importance of appeasement, acquiescence, and collaboration in creating conditions for the peaceful sharing of the lake.
