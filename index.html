# **The Evolution of Toronto and its Sailing Clubs over Time**
  One may not consider this, but the audience, location and uses for local Toronto sailing clubs reveal a great deal about the change of Toronto as a whole. By covering some of the history of a few clubs based in Lake Ontario we can pinpoint certain changes in Toronto. The following clubs will be examined: The Royal Canadian Yacht Club (RCYC), The National Yacht Club (NYC), as well as Alexandra Yacht Club (AYC) with their respective locations on the map below. It is well known that Toronto’s shoreline was not always as far-reaching as it is today, with its original shore being just south of where Front Street is today. Just as the shoreline changed, so too did the community which inhabited it. These subtle changes can be seen just from looking at the brief history of each of the sailing clubs! 

Initially known as the Toronto Boat Club, the oldest and most prestigious sailing club, RCYC, was [ordered by Queen Victoria in 1854]( http://www.thenyc.com/about-the-nyc/the-nyc-present-and-past/) to serve as an auxiliary for the British Royal Navy in defense of Lake Ontario, becoming what it is known today. In 1881 the RCYC was also forced to move to the Toronto Island to make room for the ever-growing and industrializing harbourfront. From these two tidbits we can gain a better understanding about Toronto at the time of RCYC’s inception: there was a deep connection between Toronto (or Canada as a whole) and the metropol, where Toronto would act on behalf of the Royal Navy.

The NYC and AYC, both founded slightly later have a shared history which also highlights similar changes faced by RCYC. Neither of them have a military history or ties to the monarchy, but were strictly recreational clubs that featured sailing and boating in general as the core of their community. 
In the case of Alexandra, they went from Ward’s island inland to the Aquatic Clubs reservation, by Bathurst st. in 1919. The NYC was founded on the west side of the Queens Quay Wharf by contrast, but moved close the Aquatic Clubs reservation ten years prior to Alexandra, becoming sisters from 1919 onwards. The clubs ran into problems because their location was suboptimal for boating (not deep enough for some vessels) as well as The Depression followed by the Second World War [leading to a sharp decline in membership](http://www.ayc.ca/Home/history.html). This highlights the fact that recreational activity and community entertainment dwindled in times of heightened stress as well as the fact that the shore, if it aims to include water sport clubs, must have appropriate docks. By 1950 the federal government had decided to construct steel walls in the area to protect the basin, Toronto saw itself in a time of revitalization with pavement laid and actual street signs, such as 24 Stadium Road. Leading to where both clubs are in present day, the [Toronto Harbour Commission proposed a new site for the clubs in 1983](http://www.thenyc.com/about-the-nyc/the-nyc-present-and-past/), and the new strip of land was completed and put to use in 1988. From that point onwards both Alexandra and NYC have called it home.
