# Space and Place: Toronto War Monuments
The war memorials found across Toronto represent a union of “time” and “space.” Memorials are the physical structures that “house memories in a durable fashion, anchoring the transient variable of memory itself.” (Szpunar 3) In being vessels for memory, memorials shape the spaces in which they inhabit. In Yi-Fu Tuan’s argument of “place” and “space,” he argues that “place” is created through the tapering of “space.”(Szpunar 4) That space only becomes a place when we culturally define it. Memorials act as a cultural definer of space. Infusing space it inhabits with a singular sense of culture and history. The memorials found across Toronto represent this formation of place out of the urban space of Toronto.

Some of the memorials found throughout the city of Toronto are the Soldier’s Tower, 48th Highland Memorial, The Old City Hall Cenotaph, Ontario War Veterans Memorial, and Per Ardua Ad Astra. These memorials are physical land markers in the spaces in which they inhabit. They enforce the Canadian collective memory of the World Wars.  The memorials emphasise both the victories and the sacrifices of the Canadian soldiers.

Memorials act as heritage markers, symbols of a shared past and history. The memorials found in Toronto are dedicated to the sacrifices made by the Canadian soldiers overseas. The Soldier’s Tower commemorates the sacrifices of University of Toronto students; the 48th Highland Memorial highlights the sacrifices of the 48th Highland regiment. The memorials found throughout Toronto all find a theme in sacrifice. Many historians such as Marvin and Ingle argue that the birth of Canada as a nation came through a “blood sacrifice” during the World Wars. (Szpunar 5) The memorials throughout Toronto highlight the theme of sacrifice, some memorials highlight the sacrifice of a specific group either University of Toronto students or a specific military group such as the air force. The memorials selectively remind the viewers of the sacrifices made and unite them in empathy for those lost.

The memorials found in Toronto physically mark up the land with historical and cultural meaning. Memorials manipulate space in both their cultural and physical context. As Yi-Fu Tuan argues space is this abstract freedom, free from any specific connotation or meaning. Place is the construction of meaning within space.(Szpunar 3) In viewing the satellite map, the cultural impact of memorials are not inherently seen, but it is the memorials that ultimately give meaning and cultural definition to space. Memorials by their very definition are the symbolic structures representative of memory. The memorials found in Toronto, therefore, are creating a cultural and historic narrative that, through the theme of sacrifice, work to build a collective memory of past events in Canada. The memorials found in Toronto work to create a sense of sameness through a shared history of events. The Great Wars are seen as the stepping stones to nationhood in Canada insomuch as the memorials represent sacrifices they also act as a symbol of Canadian nationalism. The memorials found in Toronto, and all across Canada work to instill Canadian culture in the space it manipulates using the theme of sacrifice to unite Canadians past and present, across space and time.
