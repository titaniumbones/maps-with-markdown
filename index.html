### Strategic Commerce, Diplomacy, and Warfare in the Lake Ontario Region

The Great Lakes region has always been a contested territory,
control over which meant access to transportation, sustenance, and trade.
Before the arrival of the French, British, and eventually, the Americans, the Iroquois, Huron, and Algonquin tribes competed for the rich resources which the Lake and its region offered.
Once the Europeans arrived it became evident that mutual accommodation over the Great Lakes became necessary, as the space became what Richard White calls the “Middle Ground” for both formal and informal interactions between the Native Americans and the settlers [(Contested Territories: xiv)](http://strapdownjs.com/). The opinion of “to whom” the Lakes belonged seemed to irrevocably diverge between the two groups. The Iroquois who met with their rivals, the French in 1700 to discuss a settlement of peace claimed that the northern part of the lake, surrounding Fort Frontenac was theirs to hunt and fish freely, “since the beginning of the world." The agreed mutual use of the regions of Lake Ontario demonstrated that, as trader and interpreter John wrote, the “necessity, of a strict alliance with them [Native Americans] as long as we retain any possessions in Canada."
