# This Map will eventually Become some kind of tour of Toronto.

Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/].

Then add those places to the marker array in [script.js](./script.js) (see instructions there).

replace this text and the text with your essay. But be sure not to eliminate the html elements that
are contained inside this textarea, or your map won't work at all!

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, above the map and buttons. To change the bootswatch thenme, change "united" to one of the other theme names listed at [strapdownjs.com](http://strapdownjs.com/).

<div class="">
  <!-- these buttons hide/show all the markers  -->
  <!-- to hide/show blue or red markers instead, change my_markers below to blue_markers
       to red_markers.  If you have defined your own color (or other) arrays, use those instead -->

        <h1>The Importance of Fort York</h1>

 <p>Toronto is one of the well known cities in Canada, the land has many history. A memorable war that happened in Toronto is the Battle of York. The Battle of York was part of the war of 1812. On April 27, 1813, the Americans landed on shore and advanced to capture the fort. The fort was ordered to be constructed by the Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. The location of Fort York was a strategic move by the Lieutenant Governor. The importance of Fort York is highlighted in the location of the fort, and the history it represents till this day.</p>


<p>John Graves Simcoe decided to position the fort in the location it exists today. He thought it was an ideal location for a settlement and a great military advantage. It was an ideal location because the fort was the only western entrance from Lake Ontario. The fort was a natural place to defend against enemy attacks. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_York) The distance of the fort was far enough from the Americans. The natural harbour and the wide open space with a high rise ground made it easy to spot enemies approaching the fort (http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=3677). Because of the security of the fort with many military advantages, settlers were attracted to the location. Soon developed and created the city of Toronto (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York,_Upper_Canada). Although Fort York was captured by the Americans, Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, was outnumbered greatly and had to retreat back to Kingston (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_York#American_planning).</p>


<p>May 25 1934, Fort York opened as a historic site museum to the public. The City of Toronto restored Fort York in 1932 and finished 1934. Fort York holds the largest collection of the war of 1812 buildings. The fort has seven original buildings and one reconstructed building (The Blue Barrack). A significant amount of the Blue Barrack is materials of 1814. It was reconstructed to create employment during the Great Depression. The buildings are examples of the British military structures (http://fortyork.ca/history-of-fort-york.html).</p>


<p>The buildings contain artifacts from the war of 1812. They have a collection of dining cutleries to muskets and pistols from that timeline. Fort York has actors reenacting the soldiers and the wives of the soldiers. The actors demonstrate the drills done by the soldiers of 1812. They also do a musket demonstration.They explain the battle strategies used and explain the formations used in combat. Afterwards, the soldiers would show a live musket demonstration. There are activities children can participate in that are real activities children from the 1812 would do in the fort (http://fortyork.ca).</p>


<p>Fort York played an important role back in the 1800s. The location being a critical military strategy that aided in the growth of the settlement which eventually became the city of Toronto. It still plays an important role today. Fort York brings the 1812 back to life. Visitors can travel back in time and experience the life in 1812. Showing the visitors what the life was back in 1812 help spark the history fanatic within us. Exposing children to a different form of learning and experiencing a fun way to learn history rather than through textbooks. Inspiring the history passion to the younger generation.</p>
